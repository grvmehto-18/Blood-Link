                style="font-size: 17px; margin-top: 60px;">A blood bank is a vital facility that collects, tests, processes, and stores blood and its components for medical use. 
                It plays a crucial role in providing safe blood for transfusions, particularly for patients undergoing surgery, trauma care, 
                or those with certain medical conditions. Blood banks actively recruit voluntary donors, ensuring that donated blood is thoroughly 
                screened for infectious diseases and properly typed to match recipients. The collected blood is separated into its componentsâ€”such as 
                red blood cells, plasma, and plateletsâ€”each tailored to meet specific patient needs. With stringent storage protocols to maintain blood 
                viability, blood banks work closely with hospitals to ensure a reliable supply for emergencies, making them essential to modern healthcare.</pre>
